Her knack for visualization makes even the most challenging problems easy to understand. Thao has helped me numerous times to grasp difficult questions, guiding me with her straightforward explanations and supportive approach. Beyond her technical abilities, Thao is one of the most hardworking and reliable individuals I know. She is a constant source of motivation, always pushing herself and those around her to reach their fullest potential. Her passion for AI research is evident in the quality of her work, and I have no doubt she will continue to excel in all her future endeavors.üëç",
